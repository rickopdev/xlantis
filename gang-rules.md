# XLANTIS CITY ROLEPLAY - GANG RULES

**Document Type:** Game Rules  
**Category:** Gang Guidelines  
**Last Updated:** 2025  
**Server:** XLANTIS CITY ROLEPLAY  

---

## OVERVIEW

The following set of rules describe the guidelines to be followed by the Gangs Registered with XLANTIS and those who wish to be a part of XLANTIS CITY ROLEPLAY's Gang Community.

Being a Part of XLANTIS City's X-Gang requires Good Role Play and a Good Understanding of the Criminal Underworld. To become a Gang you must first apply for it, and if accepted, you will be granted access and abilities far more different from those available to a regular criminal. This is to further enhance and improve your Role Play interactions as a Criminal.

At XLANTIS CITY, there is no defined Gang Type and so everyone is free is Role Play with their own story, origin and approach, within the scope of what is acceptable in regards to the Rules and Guidelines of the City.

## SITUATION TYPES

### Initial Situations
An initial situation is a situation that was created by hostile talks to activities. Only members who were in the city at the time of the attack/hostilities would take part in this Initial Situation. Initial Situations lead to Pre-War Situations.

### Pre-War Situations
Pre-War Situations are situations that occur after an initial fighting situation or situation.

**Examples:**
- Initially, a member of a Gang was killed for some reason by another Gang, in reaction to this (by seeing or getting the information) the rest of the Gang Members start a fighting situation that leads to one side getting majority loss
- If a Gang Member from Team A was taken as a hostage by Team B and later killed or released

**Rules:**
- A Pre-War Situation is a situation that involves all members of the Gang, including "Family Members". There is no maximum count for a Pre-War Situation
- In a Pre-War Situation, the vehicle count is as follows: 6 Vehicles and 1 Helicopter (Server Provided Heli)
- No Civilian Vehicles can be used
- Members involved in a Pre-War Situation must be in their Gang Dress
- A single situation can't be taken for more than 24 hours; if it happens, the gang will receive violation points, & individual action will be taken

## CALLING A MEETING

### Meeting Rules
- **Once in a Pre-War, one side gets all down, the Gang that goes all down must clearly communicate the fact. The team that is all down will be the one to call a meeting**
- **"We GANG A wants to meet GANG B at the Meeting Location"**
- **Gang Meetings are called between 2 Gangs that have conducted a Pre-War or Initial Situation Gang Meetings are done to discuss what happened and what the gangs do from there**
- **The Gang Meeting Area (at the Vinewood Sign) is a Semi-Safezone. That means that no firing situation or any kind of violence can occur in the premises of the Meeting Area**
- **Once a meeting has been called by Team A, Team B has 15 Mins to accept the meeting and arrive at the meeting location. (Both Teams have 15 Mins to arrive from the time of being called.)**
- **A Meeting at the Gang Meeting Area can only be called after a Pre-War situation has occurred to call a war or drop the situation. For all other meetings, you can choose your own meeting location excluding the Safezones**
- **Once a Gang Meeting has been accepted, the situation that was on-going has been ended, the only continuation is to either continue with a war (post-meeting) or drop the situation entirely after the meeting**

- **In every gang situation, players must wear their gang outfit and use the gang vehicle and have the Gang Tag in their FiveM name. Civilian Vehicles are not allowed to be used in Gang Situations**
- **Gang members cannot initiate or trigger any situations through chats. Creating an unwanted situation through chats will result in 70 violation points, and individual FRP actions will also be taken**
- **Gang members should avoid abusing anyone, there's no such special consideration for female members participating in gangs. Gang RP is inherently toxic, if you wish to play as a Female Character, it is up to your own risk and responsibility. This however, is not an invitation to be toxic against female characters**

- **You are not allowed to use one way buildings such as the Drug Heist buildings and you are also not allowed to use any building interiors for your advantage. Additionally you cannot hold any building Rooftop for more than 5 Mins, regardless of the situation. In such cases, the XGOD on duty will put out an announcement as a warning**

### Death and Re-entry Rules
- **Dead players can't enter any situations. (Including gang war and non-gang war situations) regardless of how you died**
- **A single situation can't be taken for more than 24 hours; if it happens, the gang will receive violation points, and individual action will be taken**
- **This does not mean a new situation with the same party can be created to circumvent this**
