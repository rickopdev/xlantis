- **By applying to be a part of the Government Sector of XLANTIS, you are creating Roleplay opportunities for both yourself and other players. Don't just join these jobs for the sake of gaining a 2nd Character only to never go for the Job. This negatively affects other players and the respective department teams**
- **If found that you have been inactive without proper reason in the Government Job you've been accepted into, you will be removed after an initial warning and your Character Deleted**
- **If you are abusing the privilege of having a 2nd Character for any Government Job, you will be Blacklisted from gaining any additional Characters and re-applying for the 2nd Character after it's deletion**
