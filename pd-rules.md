## BASIC POLICE RULES AND INTERACTION RULES

### Safezone and Arrest Rules
- **Firing towards PD (Safe Zone) is considered as FRP (Fail Roleplay). If the PD is unable to leave the PD Safezone they are allowed to fire out of the Safezone. However, they are only allowed to hold the area for a maximum of 20 minutes**
- **PD has the right to arrest a player once a government-issued arrest warrant is in place, regardless of the location (Safe Zone, Gang House, City Limits)**

### Situation Participation
- **If a player isn't part of an ongoing robbery or shooting situation, then they're not supposed to get involved. Getting involved will be considered as FRP**
- **If you are caught with an illegal weapon in public, the PD has the power to handcuff you and confiscate the weapon**
- **All on-duty officers (officers who are available during the situation) can be involved in an unexpected or 144 situation**
- **An on-duty officer cannot be taken hostage or kidnapped**

### Hostage and Demand Rules
- **Taking a hostage for any kind of resource exchange, such as cash or other valuable items, against PD will be considered as FRP**

### Revival and Re-entry Rules
- **Dead players from both sides cannot re-enter a situation with PD unless the XMD has revived them. In this case, if the XMD has revived a suspect, the suspect can attempt to flee but cannot attack the PD**
- **If a Combat Medic has revived you, you cannot attempt to flee and must surrender immediately**

### Combat and War Rules
- **Players are not permitted to re-initiate or take part in a scenario in which a 144 has been issued. Open war cannot be declared against PD**

### Punishment and Compliance
- **PD has the right to impose jail time (15-30 mins) in cases of cop baiting and unwanted triggering (disrespecting an officer)**

---

## HIERARCHY

### Authority Structure
- **The hierarchy of PD shouldn't be based on the number of PD players or gun power. Even if it's a single PD officer, citizens (including gangs) should follow the hierarchy and act accordingly towards the police**

### Firing Situations
Players cannot create an unwanted firing situation with the police. Players are allowed to fire at the PD only in the below scenarios:

**A. If PD initiates a firing towards you**

**B. If random firing is going on in the city and the PD declares a 144 situation, in this case only the players who are actively a part of that firing situation can engage in that 144 situation (players who are not part of the situation shouldn't engage)**

**C. If an arrest warrant or wanted action is initiated against you**

### Arrest and Compliance
- **If PD tries to take you into custody when you commit a crime, then you can try to escape by running away, not by firing them. If PD cuffs you for the wrong reason, you can call an advocate or talk by yourself with a valid reason and proof. In any case, if the police arrest you without any reason, then players can raise a complaint in the complaint box (discord) against PD with proof or POV**
- **It's mandatory that you need to follow PD commands; such as, if an on-duty officer finds you carrying a gun, they will ask you to keep it inside and it's mandatory that you follow their command rather than denying and doing the exact opposite. PD can take you into custody if anything such happens**

### Behavior and Cooperation
- **Inappropriate behavior against PD won't be promoted. PD will only be talking to you with respect and they expect the same in return, you're only allowed to tease or criticize the PD if they start to do the same against you**
- **PD cannot jail or fine citizens without a solid reason**
- **If the suspect gives a good, valid reason that he or she didn't commit any crime, then the police have to cooperate with them. If a PD officer misuses their power, strict action will be taken**

### Jurisdiction and Response
- **PD won't attend or respond to any situations that occur outside the city limits unless they witness the situation firsthand or receive information about it**
- **Trespassing in any official government area is strictly prohibited, and the PD has the right to take action**

### Water and Pursuit Rules
- **In a robbery situation, if it ends in water, the police will use announcements to call the robber to shore. The robber should then return and surrender to the police in this scenario. Robbers can however, use boats and water based vehicles to escape if the escape RP has been pre-planned. You can only swim in the water for 5 Mins**

### Traffic Stop Rules
- **For Traffic Stop RPs, only the people inside the vehicle getting pulled over for the Traffic Stop are allowed to involve themselves with the stop. No other persons can involve themselves with that scenario**
